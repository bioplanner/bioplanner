  "original description": "This is a method for VSMC isolation from mouse aorta by an explant method adapted from Metz et al (2012).",
  "steps": "\nMouse preparation\n1. Sacrifice mouse (10-week old, Balb/c) with an overdose intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital.\n2. Dip the mouse into a beaker filled with 70% ethanol, fix into an operation tray, bring into laminar air flow.\n\nAorta isolation\n3. With sterilized surgical instruments, open the mouse, dissect the thoracic aorta.\n4. Wash the aorta in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS).\n5. Keep the aorta in a dish\u00a0on ice, remove the connective tissue and the adventitia.\n6. Transfer into a new dish with fresh HBSS.\n7. Cut open the aorta longitudinally, remove\u00a0the endothelial layers by gentle scrape with a sterile cotton swab.\n8. Cut the aorta into 4 pieces (around 4 mm2 each), wash in\u00a0Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/Ham\u2019s F12 (DMEM/F12) (Gibco).\n\nMedia explant\n9. Transfer the aorta pieces into\u00a0a collagen-coated culture dish (35 mm), press with the luminal side down on the dish. \u00a0Spread the\u00a0aorta out over as large as possible. \u00a0\u00a0\nNOTES Prepare the collagen-coated culture dish in advance.  Add 1-2 ml collagen, incubate 30-60 minutes at room temperature, rinse with PBS three times, keep the last PBS up to use.\n10. Incubate for 5 min in a 37oC, 5% CO2 incubator in a tilting position.\n37temperature \n300s\n11. Check and make sure the media explant attached to the dish. Prolonged the incubation for another 1-3 minutes if necessary.\nNOTES Be careful not to dry the media explant.\n12. Very slowly add fresh medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and antibiotics (70 mg/ ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin) it just covers the aorta. \u00a0Start with 100\u00a0\u03bcl up to 500\u00a0\u03bcl.\nNOTES Make sure not to disturb the attachment of explants to the dish.\n13. Place the dish in the incubator and left undisturbed for 4 days.\n14. At day 5, add fresh medium and then change every 3 days. Observe the cells that had migrated from the medial explant under a microscope when changing medium.\n\nCulture of VSMCs\n15. When the migrated cells from media explants are confluent, harvest with trypsinization.\n16. Count the cells and pool cells from media explants from 3 mice into one dish (0.5-1x105 cells/35 mm dish), culture in\u00a010%FBS/DMEM/F12 (complete medium) as needed thereafter for experiments. This is passage 1.\n",
